Positioning In Named Areas

* An alternative to counting rows and columns is to name parts of your grid. 
    These named parts are called 'grid areas'

* CSS property `grid-template-areas` is used to create a grid area

* Points about creating grid areas
    1. Must name every grid area
    2. If you don't want name an area, use `.`
    3. Each group separated by quotes denotes a row ("row 1" "row 2")
    4. Each value within a quote signifies an area ("area1 area2")

* To place items on a grid area, use `grid-area`
    - the below example applies class xyz onto the grid areas that match the name 'dinkle'
.xyz {
    grid-area: dinkle;
}


* The below example has 3 grid areas
    1. header on the first row takes up 4 columns (grid areas)
    2. main on the second row takes up the middle 2 columns
    3. footer on the third row takes up 4 columns

.grid {
    grid-template-areas:    "header header header header"
                            ".      main   main   .     "
                            "footer footer footer footer";
}
