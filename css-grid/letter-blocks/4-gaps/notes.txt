Gaps

* The spaces between columns and rows in a Grid can be specified.
    - These spaces are called Gaps

* Three CSS properties to remember
    1 `grid-column-gap` - space between columns
    2 `grid-row-gap`    - space between rows
    3 `grid-gap`        - shorthand for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap (in that order)
                            ~ if one value specified, use value for both

* The following are equivalent
.grid {
    grid-column-gap: 1-em;
    grid-row-gap: 2-em;
}
.grid {
    grid-gap: 2-em 1-em;
}
