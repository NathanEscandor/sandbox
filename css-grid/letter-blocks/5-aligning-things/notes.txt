Aligning Things

* There are 6 properties that deal with aligning things
    1. justify-content
    2. align-content
    3. justify-items
    4. align-items
    5. justify-self
    6. align-self

* Two groups here
    - justify vs align
        justify: Change the alignment according to the inline-axis
        align:   Change the alignment according to the block-axis

    - content, items, self
        content: aligns the grid itself to available space outside of the grid
                    ~ this is only needed if grid is smaller than defined area (RARE)
        items: aligns grid item to any available whitespace in the cell (COMMON)
        self: same thing as items, except it aligns for only ONE grid item.

* Inline and Block axes
    1. Identify direction of the language (English)
    2. Inline-axis: way you read the language (Left to Right)
    3. Block-axis:  way you read after the end of the first line (Top to Bottom)

* Content: justify-content and align-content
