In this directory, I'm going back to the basics to try and build a foundation in html and css.
Was working through some FrontEndMasters stuff on CSS and realized that even the low-level FEM lectures were too high level for me.

Throughout the book, slowly working through building out the 'my-smarter-site' directory. 
It doesn't seem like every chapter updates the site so I'll have a copy of the changes + update the main sandbox/smarter_way-html_css/my-smarter-site directory to sync with the most recent chapter.

Came across this book by Mark Myers through recommendation from multiple youtube frontend dev channels. Gonna try to stick with it as much as possible.
