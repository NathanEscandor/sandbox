In this directory, I'm going back to the basics to try and build a foundation in html and css.
Was working through some FrontEndMasters stuff on CSS and realized that even the low-level FEM lectures were too high level for me.

Came across this book by Mark Myers through recommendation from multiple youtube frontend dev channels. Gonna try to stick with it as much as possible.
