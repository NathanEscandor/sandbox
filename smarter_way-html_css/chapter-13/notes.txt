13 - Spacing

* Can create styles for text spacing.
* letter-spacing: 0; --> default
    -.1 em; tightens spacing
    .1 em; spreads spacing

* can also adjust spacing between words with the `word-spacing` property
    This isn't used often.
    Most common use is to slightly open the space between bolded words

* in addition, can adjust spacing between lines (better legibility?) with the `line-height` property
    for line-height: 1.2em; --> default!
