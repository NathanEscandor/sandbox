* This chapter introduced the idea of html tags, particularly the paragraph (<p>) tag. 
* Opening tags (<open>) vs closing tags (</open).
* <P> also usually works for paragraph but probably shouldn't ever be used.

<html>
  Line 1
  Line 2
</html>
would output: `Line 1Line 2`

~ Adding paragraph tags around Line 1 and Line 2 would output:
`Line 1
Line 2`
