Specifying Fonts

* Talked about adding css styling to a page. We added styles.css to the my-smarter-site dir.
* It styles paragraphs (p) and largest header (h1) with the font-family set to a 'font stack' of Georgia, "TNR", Times, serif.
* Font Stack
    - If first font choice isn't installed, will back up to the next in the stack until it finds one that works
    - last fallback in the stack is always the generic (sans-serif or serif) to guarantee that something can render 

* There exist common lists of web safe font stacks to use. Can probably look it up when appropriate.
