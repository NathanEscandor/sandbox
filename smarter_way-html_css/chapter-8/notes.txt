7 - CSS Classes

* We can make classes of paragraphs and headings that vary from the general stylings for <p> and <hX>
* In fact, we can make classes for just about any element on the page for custom formatting.

CSS example below will override the font-size of h2 headers that have class="bigger"
h2.bigger {
    font-size: 2.5em;
}

HTML example below will apply css for special {}, conspicuous {}, and enhanced {} to the h3.
<h3 class="special conspicuous enhanced">Hello now!!</h3>
